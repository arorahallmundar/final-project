## When Do Shootings Happen?

So far, we've looked at who is most involved in gun violence in NYC and who they target. But timing matters too.

Understanding who is involved in gun violence is only part of the story, when these incidents occur adds another important dimension. By looking at time-based patterns, we begin to uncover how social rhythms, daily routines, seasons, and even major societal events influence the likelihood of violence.

In this section, we explore three different time scales: 
- **Hour of Day** - When are shootings most likely to occur during a 24-hour period?
- **Yearly Trends** - How has the overall volume of gun violence changed over time?
- **Seasonal Patterns** - Are some months consistently more violent than others?

Together, these views help reveal the deeper structure of time in New York City’s gun violence.

### Time of day

We begin with a breakdown of shootings by hour of day, separated by gender and age group of the perpetrator. This chart helps us understand how the city’s daily rhythm intersects with violent incidents.

One group dominates the late-night activity: young men aged 18–24. Their involvement in shootings peaks during the evening and early morning hours, aligning with times of increased social activity, reduced visibility, and greater exposure to risky environments.

In contrast, shootings involving women or older individuals are relatively rare and show a much flatter distribution across the day. Their trends are not as tightly tied to nighttime hours, suggesting different social contexts and circumstances.

These timing patterns reflect deeper social dynamics, offering potential clues for more informed prevention efforts and community-based interventions
