##  Where Does Gun Violence Happen?

When discussing gun violence, *where* it occurs is just as important as *who* is involved. In a city as large and diverse as New York, some areas experience far more incidents than others and understanding these geographic patterns is essential for meaningful insights.

Gun violence is not spread evenly across the five boroughs. Instead, it clusters in specific neighborhoods, reflecting deeper social, economic, and structural conditions.

###  Borough Breakdown

The choropleth map below shows the total number of shootings recorded in each borough.

Two boroughs stand out: **Brooklyn and the Bronx** consistently experience significantly more shootings than Manhattan, Queens, or Staten Island.

This disparity goes beyond population differences. It reflects long-standing inequalities in areas like income, housing stability, policing, and access to community resources. These underlying conditions contribute to a higher risk of violence - and a higher burden placed on certain communities.

**Figure 9:** *This animated heatmap visualizes the density of shootings by hour and location across NYC. Darker red areas indicate higher concentrations. Hover over each borough to see the total number of shooting incidents recorded there.*

## Hour-by-Hour: Mapping Shooting Density Over Time

Now let’s take a closer look at how time and location come together.

The animated heatmap below shows where shootings happen across NYC during different hours of the day. As the timeline moves, a clear pattern shows up, late evenings and early mornings tend to be the most active - especially in areas like Brooklyn and the Bronx.

This kind of view helps us understand how gun violence shifts throughout the day. It’s not random follows people’s routines, social activities, and the way life changes as day turns into night.

Where and when shootings happen go together and both are key to prevention.

**Figure 10:** *This animated heatmap shows how shooting density changes throughout a 24-hour cycle across NYC. Darker red areas indicate higher concentrations. Watch how intensity shifts by hour, and use the timeline to pause or scrub through different times of day*


### Where Age Meets Place: Borough level Shooting Patterns

While total shootings per borough highlight where violence is concentrated, they don’t reveal who
is most involved in each area. To uncover deeper spatial patterns, the boxplot below breaks down the **yearly distribution of shootings by age group within each borough**.

This visualization offers several key insights:

- In **Brooklyn** and the **Bronx**, the **18–24** and **25–44** age groups consistently account for the most shootings each year, with wider spreads indicating frequent spikes.
- **Younger perpetrators (<18)** are present in every borough, but particularly more visible in Brooklyn.
- **Manhattan** and **Queens** show lower, more stable counts across all age groups, suggesting fewer high-risk incidents.
- **Staten Island** consistently reports the fewest shootings across all groups, reinforcing its position as the least affected borough.

By combining geography and age group, we gain a richer understanding of the *spatial dimensions* of gun violence—helping to inform more targeted interventions where they are needed most.
