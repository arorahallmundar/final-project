## Who is Involved?

### Gender breakdown
To begin answering our main research question **"Who shoots whom?"** we started by looking at one of the most visible factors: gender.


**Figure 1** shows that men are overwhelmingly central to gun violence in New York City. They make up the vast majority of both shooters and victims. While women do appear in the data, they are far less frequently involved, and when they are, it is most often as victims rather than perpetrators.

**Figure 1:** *Interactive Bokeh bar chart showing the number of shooting incidents by gender, role (perpetrator or victim), and age group. Each bar represents the count of incidents involving people from that group. Use the legend in the upper-left corner to select or de-select age groups, and compare how different age ranges contribute to each gender-role category*

This trend is not unique to New York. National statistics show a similar pattern, with over 90 percent of homicideperpetrators and about 85 percent of victims are male ([Everytown Research, 2021](https://everytownresearch.org/report/guns-and-violence-against-women/)).

The bar chart in **Figure 1** illustrates this clearly. It breaks down incidents by gender, role, and age group, showing that young men between the ages of 18 and 44 are especially overrepresented among both victims and perpetrators.


### Gender patterns
To go a step further, we looked at **how the genders of shooters and victims interact**.

The heatmap below shows all shootings where both the perpetrator’s and the victim’s gender were recorded. One pattern immediately stands out: **most shootings involve men on both sides**.

**Figure 2:** *Gender-based heatmap of shooter and victim relationships. This heatmap breaks down shootings by the gender of both shooter and victim. The darker the color, the more frequent the combination.*

Incidents where men shoot other men are by far the most common. Female shooters are rare, and when they do, they are more likely to shoot male victims than female ones.

This gives us a clearer picture: when gun violence happens in New York City, it's most often **men shooting other men**.

### Age Patterns in Gun Violence

Beyond gender, age plays a major role in shaping who gets involved in shootings. 
The chart below breaks down the relationship between perpetrators and victims across age groups, showing whether violence tends to happen within or across generations.

What stands out is a clear age mirroring effect: younger individuals, especially those aged 18–24 and 25–44, are both the most common perpetrators and the most frequent victims. This suggests that gun violence in NYC often occurs between individuals of similar age, rather than across generational lines.

The heatmap in **Figure 3** below lets you explore how each age group is involved on both sides of the incident.

**Figure 3:** *Heatmap showing the relationship between shooter and victim age groups. Along the side are shooter age groups, and along the bottom are victim age groups. Each square shows how many incidents involve those two groups.*


### Putting It All Together
To get a fuller view of the dynamics behind gun violence, we combined both gender and age into one comprehensive breakdown. The heatmap on **Figure 4** shows every recorded shooting where both the perpetrator’s and the victim’s age and gender were available.

**Figure 4:** *This chart combines age and gender for both shooter and victim, showing the full demographic breakdown of shootings. Each row shows a specific group of shooters (e.g., “Male 18–24”), and each column shows a victim group.*

Each row in the chart represents a group of perpetrators, and each column shows their victims. This allows us to see not just who is involved, but who is shooting whom across different age groups.

One pattern is immediately clear: Men between the ages of 18 and 44 are the most frequent perpetrators and also the most common victims. By contrast, women appear far less often in the data, whether as perpetrators or victims.

This chart brings the central pattern of NYC gun violence into sharp focus: It is concentrated within a small and specific demographic.!
