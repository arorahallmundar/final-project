## Who is Involved?

### Gender breakdown
To begin answering our main research question **"Who shoots whom?"** we started by looking at one of the most visible factors: gender.

One finding stood out immediately: **men are at the center of gun violence in New York City.** They make up the vast majority of both victims and shooters. While women do appear in the data, they are far less frequently involved, and typically as victims rather than perpetrators.

This trend isn’t unique to NYC. Nationwide data shows similar patterns: over 90% of homicide perpetrators and about 85% of victims are male ([Everytown Research, 2021](https://everytownresearch.org/report/guns-and-violence-against-women/)).

The bar chart in Figure 1 makes this pattern immediately clear:

### Gender patterns
To go a step further, we looked at **how the genders of shooters and victims interact**.

The heatmap below shows all shootings where both the perpetrator’s and the victim’s gender were recorded. One pattern immediately stands out: **most shootings involve men on both sides**.

Incidents where men shoot other men are by far the most common. Female shooters are rare, and when they do, they are more likely to shoot male victims than female ones.

This gives us a clearer picture: when gun violence happens in New York City, it's most often **men shooting other men**.

### Age Patterns in Gun Violence

Beyond gender, age plays a major role in shaping who gets involved in shootings. 
The chart below breaks down the relationship between perpetrators and victims across age groups, showing whether violence tends to happen within or across generations.

What stands out is a clear age mirroring effect: younger individuals, especially those aged 18–24 and 25–44, are both the most common perpetrators and the most frequent victims. This suggests that gun violence in NYC is often peer-to-peer rather than cross-generational.

The heatmap below lets you explore how each age group is involved on both sides of the incident.

### Putting It All Together
To get a fuller view of the dynamics behind gun violence, we combined both gender and age into one comprehensive breakdown. The heatmap below shows every recorded shooting where both the perpetrator’s and the victim’s age and gender were available.

Each row represents a specific shooter group, for example, males aged 18–24 — while each column shows the corresponding victim group. This lets us see not just who is involved, but who is shooting whom, across every demographic.

One trend becomes unmistakably clear: the vast majority of shootings are carried out by young men targeting other young men. In particular, males aged 18–44 are both the most active perpetrators and the most frequent victims. In contrast, incidents involving women - either as shooters or victims remain relatively rare.

This chart brings the central pattern of NYC gun violence into sharp focus:
It is overwhelmingly concentrated within a small and specific demographic.
