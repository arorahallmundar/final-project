# Who Shoots Whom?  
### A Demographic Breakdown of Gun Violence in NYC

Gun violence continues to affect thousands of lives in New York City — but **who is most involved**, and **how do these patterns take shape**?

- Is there a typical profile for a victim or a perpetrator?  
- Do these incidents happen at specific times?  
- Are some boroughs hit harder than others?

These aren’t just statistics — they represent real people, neighborhoods, and communities.  
Understanding the patterns behind violence can help inform **better prevention**, **smarter policy**, and **deeper public awareness**.

In this project, we dive into public NYPD data on shooting incidents to uncover how **gender**, **age**, **time**, and **location** intersect in shaping the landscape of gun violence in the city.

We examine who is most at risk, when shootings tend to happen, and where incidents cluster — not to sensationalize, but to **see the structure beneath the chaos.**

> Because when it comes to public safety, **the details matter.**

## About the Data

The dataset comes from the [NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Historic)](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-shooting-incident-data-historic), covering all recorded shootings in NYC from **2006 to 2023**.

Each entry contains:
- **Date, time, and borough** of the incident
- **Victim and perpetrator demographics** (age, sex, race)
- **Weapon used** and **circumstances** of the shooting

The data is compiled and reviewed quarterly by the NYPD Office of Management Analysis and Planning.

## Where Do Shootings Happen?

We'll begin by mapping the geographic spread of incidents to see where gun violence is most concentrated.
 *[Interactive map coming soon]*

---

## When Do Shootings Occur?

Do shootings happen at certain times of the day or days of the week?  
We explore temporal patterns that might reveal underlying behaviors or risks.

*[Bar chart of shootings by hour/day coming soon]*

---

## Who Are the Victims and Perpetrators?

We break down the demographic data to examine:
- Age and gender of victims
- Age and gender of perpetrators
- How these groups overlap — and how they change over time

*[Demographic charts and analysis coming soon]*

---

## How Has Gun Violence Changed Over Time?

Has gun violence increased or decreased?  
Are there notable spikes in particular years, such as 2020?

 *[Timeline chart coming soon]*

## Why It Matters

Understanding these patterns is about more than numbers — it's about uncovering the social dynamics behind public safety.  
Our goal is not to simplify, but to visualize a complex issue with clarity, respect, and curiosity.
