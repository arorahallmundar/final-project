Gun violence continues to impact communities across New York City, with thousands of shooting incidents reported over the past two decades. But beyond the raw numbers lies a deeper question: **Who is shooting whom and under what circumstances?**

Are young men the primary perpetrators and victims? Do these incidents follow daily or seasonal rhythms? Are certain neighborhoods consistently more affected?

Gun violence has long been a central issue in the United States, debated politically, studied socially, and felt personally. And in NYC, efforts to reduce shootings are ongoing. Programs like the [Office to Prevent Gun Violence](https://criminaljustice.cityofnewyork.us/programs/office-to-prevent-gun-violence/) work to address these issues on the ground. However, to prevent violence effectively, we also need to understand the patterns behind it.

In this project, we dive into public [NYPD shooting incident data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-shooting-incident-data-historic), containing information about shootings in NYC from 2006-2024, to examine how gender, age, time, and location intersect in shaping the landscape of urban gun violence.

Our guiding question is:
#### **“Who shoots whom in New York City, and how do patterns of age, gender, place, and time influence that dynamic?”**

Through all sorts of visualizations, we aim to go beyond headlines and uncover the underlying structure of these events, not to sensationalize, but to support clearer understanding, smarter prevention, and stronger public awareness.

reword - Age Patterns in Gun Violence

Beyond gender, age plays a major role in shaping who gets involved in shootings. 
The chart below breaks down the relationship between perpetrators and victims across age groups, showing whether violence tends to happen within or across generations.

What stands out is a clear age mirroring effect: younger individuals, especially those aged 18–24 and 25–44, are both the most common perpetrators and the most frequent victims. This suggests that gun violence in NYC often occurs between individuals of similar age, rather than across generational lines.

The heatmap in **Figure 3** below lets you explore how each age group is involved on both sides of the incident.



Each row in the chart represents a group of perpetrators, and each column shows their victims. This allows us to see not just who is involved, but who is shooting whom across different age groups.

One pattern is immediately clear: Men between the ages of 18 and 44 are the most frequent perpetrators and also the most common victims. By contrast, women appear far less often in the data, whether as perpetrators or victims.

This chart brings the central pattern of NYC gun violence into sharp focus: It is concentrated within a small and specific demographic.
